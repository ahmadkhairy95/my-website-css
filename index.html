<p style="color:#4DB6AC;text-align: justify;">Hiya! I'm Khairy. I'm 22 years old and I was born and raised in Kelantan, Malaysia.<br>

<br>I grew up obsessed with football and did it for 7 years since year five. Playing football was my only passion as a teen and all I could ever see myself doing. But it ended up after I finished high school about a year ago and decided to take a year off to travel with my friends. I soon found myself so close to the wild and nature. It's one of the factors that contributed to me finding new passions to focus on. This present day, I've been involved in many outdoors passion such as backpacking, hiking, camping and my favourite is kayaking.<br>

<br>In 2017, I further my studies in diploma and I got accepted in UiTM Machang for Computer Science Program. I'm not that good at calculation. It's quite tough for me but I finished my studies anyway. Meanwhile, for my degree level, I choose to go with a different path which is Marketing Program in UiTM Kota Bharu. That's mean I shifted from FSKM to FPP. It does effect my study duration which is I need to start from semester 1. My other friends who didn't shifted like me, they can skipped and made it through directly to semester 2.<br>

<br>Currently, it's been a month since semester 2 started. I'm very thankful for everything that happened in my life. It's the experiences that shape the person I'm today. So, that's it from me. See ya soon! Peace!</p>
